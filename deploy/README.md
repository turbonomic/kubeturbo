## Helm Chart

Helm charts are an easy way to deploy and update kubeturbo.  We provide you a helm chart that you can download locally, and install specifying a few parameters.

For more details go to the [Helm Chart option](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/wiki/Helm-Deployment-Details).


## Deploy with YAMLs

You can deploy the kubeturbo pod using yamls that define the resources required.  For more information, go to [Deploy Resources via yaml](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/wiki/Yaml-Deployment-Details)

Strongly advise you to use the sample yamls provided [here](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/kubeturbo_yamls).


## Deploy with an Operator

You can leverage an Operator to call the Helm charts to deploy kubeturbo.  For details go to [Kubeturbo Operator deployment](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/wiki/Operator-Details).
