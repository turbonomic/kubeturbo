## Kubeturbo Deployment and Prerequisites #

The kubeturbo pod can be easily deployed one of 3 ways:
1. [Helm Chart](#helm-chart)
2. [Deploy Resources via yaml](#deploy-with-yamls)
3. [Operator](#deploy-with-an-operator)

This document describes common prerequisites, and an overview of each method.  Details will be in the directories. 

## Prerequisites

* OpenShift release 3.4 or higher, kubernetes version 1.8 or higher including any k8s upstream compliant distribution
* Turbonomic Server version 5.9 or higher is installed, running, and the following information:
    * Turbonomic Server URL https://<TurboIPaddressOrFQDN>
    * Turbonomic username with administrator role, and password
    * Turbonomic Server Version.  To get this from the UI, go to Settings -> Updates -> About and use the numeric version such as “6.2.11” or “6.3” (No minor version needed 6.3+. Build details not required)
    * Running Cisco Worload Operation Manager (CWOM) and looking for version mappings? Go here to see conversion chart for [CWOM -> Turbonomic Server -> kubeturbo version](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/version_mapping_kubeturbo_Turbo_CWOM.md) 
* Access and Permissions to create all the resources required:
    * User needs **cluster-admin cluster role level access** to be able to create the following resources if required: namespace, service account, and cluster role binding for the service account.
* Repo Access and Network requirements.  Refer to Figure below “Turbonomic and Kubernetes Network Detail”.
    * Instructions assume the node you are deploying to has internet access to pull the kubeturbo image from the DockerHub repository, or your environment is configured with a repo accessible by the node.  Images are available from Dockerhub and RedHat Container Catalog. The exact Tag required will be provided for you by Turbonomic.
        * [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/turbonomic/kubeturbo/)
        * [RedHat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/product/aa909a40e026139e) 
    * Kubeturbo pod will have https/tcp access to the kubelet on every node (default values assumes https is configured port=10250. If not, specify port=10255 and https is false in kubeturbo deploy)
    * Kubeturbo pod will have https/tcp access to the Turbonomic Server
    * Proxies between kubeturbo and Turbonomic Server need to allow websocket communication.
* One kubeturbo pod will be deployed per cluster or per control plane when using stretch clusters. Kubeturbo pod will run with a service account with cluster-admin role
* This pod will typically run with no more than 512 Mg Memory, less than 1 core or 1 GHz CPU, and maximum volume space of 10 G.

## Helm Chart

Helm charts are an easy way to deploy and update kubeturbo.  We provide you a helm chart that you can download locally, and install specifying a few parameters.

For more details go to [HELM_README.md](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/kubeturbo/HELM_README.md) under kubeturbo/deploy/kubeturbo/


## Deploy with YAMLs

You can deploy the kubeturbo pod using yamls that define the resources required.  Below is an overview.  For more information, go to [YAMLS_README.md](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/kubeturbo_yamls/YAMLS_README.md) under kubeturbo/deploy/kubeturbo_yamls/

Strongly advise you to use the sample yamls provided [here](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/kubeturbo_yamls).

1. Create a namespace.  Use an existing namespace, or create one where to deploy kubeturbo. The yaml examples will use `turbo`.

2. Create a service account, and add the role of cluster-admin. Assign `cluster-admin` role with a cluster role binding.  Note this role can have view only access, which will allow for metrics to be collected but cannot execute actions.

3. Create a configMap for kubeturbo, The <TURBONOMIC_SERVER_VERSION> is Turbonomic release version, e.g. 6.3 or 7.18  To distinguish between different k8s clusters, supply a targetName value which will name the k8s cluster groups created in Turbonomic.

4. Using a deployment type, deploy kubeturbo

5. Validate that you see Containers and Container Pod entities in the Turbonomic Supply Chain, and collecting data.


## Deploy with an Operator

You can leverage an Operator to call the Helm charts to deploy kubeturbo.  For details go to [kubeturbo-operator](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/kubeturbo-operator)

There's no place like home... go back to the [Turbonomic Overview](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/README.md).
