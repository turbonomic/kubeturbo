# Pod move
move a pod which is controlled by a ReplicationController, or ReplicaSet, or Deployment(via ReplicaSet).

# Three steps
 1. Create a clone Pod of the original Pod
 
   The cloned pod **podA** has everything except the labels and podName of the original Pod.
   Since **podA** has no labels, no controller will try to adopt it.
   
 2. Delete the original Pod
 
   Once the original Pod get deleted, the controller will create another new Pod **podB**.
   
 3. Update the new Pod **podA** by adding the labels
 
   Once **podA** get the labels, the matched controller will try to [adopt it](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/fa557ee7921fc8305d4978e66eb653c92ed1a7ce/pkg/controller/replicaset/replica_set.go#L333). After [the adoption](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4beb0c2f8634054950cb7ca0b4c24a12aadc612e/pkg/controller/replicaset/replica_set.go#L616), the number of living pods
   for the controller will be one more than the specified replica number, so controller will [select one pod to delete](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/4beb0c2f8634054950cb7ca0b4c24a12aadc612e/pkg/controller/replicaset/replica_set.go#L623).
   In this case, both **podA** ad **podB** is running, but **podA** is older than **podB**, so **podB** will get deleted.
