# **KubeTurbo** 

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
3. [Kubeturbo Use Cases](#use-cases)
4. [Coming Soon](#coming-soon)


## Overview 

Kubeturbo leverages [Turbonomic's](https://turbonomic.com/) patented analysis engine to provide visibility and control across the entire stack in order to assure the performance of running micro-services in Kubernetes Pods, as well as the efficiency of underlying infrastructure.

## Getting Started 
### Prerequisites
* Turbonomic 5.9+ installation
* Kubernetes 1.4+
### Kubeturbo Installation
* [Deploy Kubeturbo](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy)
* Once deployed, corresponding targets will show up in Turbonomic UI

## Use Cases
* Full-Stack Visibility by leveraging 50+ existing Turbonomic controllers, from on-prem DataCenter to major public cloud providers. No more shadow IT
  * From Load Balancer all the way down to your physical Infrastructure
  * Real-Time resource monitoring across entire DataCenter
  * Real-Time Cost visibility for your public cloud deployment

* Provide Rescheduler capability by leveraging The Turbonomic analysis engine **(Execution of moving pods requires Kubeturbo to be the scheduler of the pod)**
  * Consolidating Pods in real-time to increase node efficiency
  * Reschedule Pod in advance to prevent suffering resource congestion from the underlying node
  *	Reschedule Pod to new node added to the cluster
  *	Reschedule Pods that peak together to different nodes, to avoid performance dropping

* Right-Sizing your Pod and your entire IT stack
  *	Combining Turbonomic real-time performance monitoring and analysis engine, Turbonomic is able to provide right-sizing information for each individual pod as well as the entire IT stack.
  * Right-sizing up your Pod limit, if necessary, to avoid OOM
  * Right-sizing down your Pod requested resource, if necessary, to avoid resource overprovisioning or overspending in public cloud deployment.

## Coming Soon
* Support for Cluster Federation Control Plane
  * Complete visibility for your K8s deployments across different underlying infrastructures
  * Create affinity/anti-affinity policies directly from Turbonomic UI
  * Improve cost efficiency by consolidating workload across deployments and identifying the cheapest region and provider to deploy your workload
* What-If Planner
  * A complete What-If sandbox to help you plan your IT changes in advance
  * Plan for workload change: Add/Remove Containers
  * Plan for infrastructure change: Add/Remove/Replace hardware
  * Plan for Cloud Migration: Expense and Savings
  * Cluster Consolidation for federated clusters
