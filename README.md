Kubeturbo leverages [Turbonomic's](https://turbonomic.com/) patented analysis engine to provide visibility and control across the entire stack in order to assure the performance of running micro-services in Kubernetes Pods, as well as the efficiency of underlying infrastructure.

Running OpenShift? Turbonomic is available on the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/registry.connect.redhat.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo) of certified images, and thru the [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/?keyword=turb).
