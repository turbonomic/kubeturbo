# **KubeTurbo** 

1. [Overview](#overview)
2. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
3. [Kubeturbo Use Cases](#use-cases)
4. [Coming Soon](#coming-soon)


## Overview 

Kubeturbo leverages [Turbonomic's](https://turbonomic.com/) patented analysis engine to provide visibility and control across the entire stack in order to assure the performance of running micro-services in Kubernetes Pods, as well as the efficiency of underlying infrastructure.

## Getting Started 

### Kubeturbo Installation
* Review the prerequisites and [Deploy Kubeturbo](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/deploy/README.md).
* (Optional) To prepare Kubeturbo for debugging, [go here](https://github.com/turbonomic/kubeturbo/tree/master/debugging/README.md).
* Once deployed, corresponding k8s/OS cluster targets will show up in Turbonomic UI.

## Use Cases
* Full-Stack Visibility by leveraging 50+ existing Turbonomic controllers, from on-prem DataCenter to major public cloud providers. No more shadow IT
  * From Load Balancer all the way down to your physical Infrastructure
  * Real-Time resource monitoring across entire DataCenter
  * Real-Time Cost visibility for your public cloud deployment

* Intelligently, continuously redistribute workload under changing conditions by leveraging The Turbonomic analysis engine 
  * Consolidate Pods in real-time to increase node efficiency
  * Reschedule Pod to prevent performance degradation due to resource congestion from the underlying node
  *	Reschedule Pod to leverage resources from new node added to the cluster
  *	Reschedule Pods that peak together to different nodes, to avoid performance issues due to "noisy neighbors"

* Right-Sizing your Pod and your entire IT stack
  *	Combining Turbonomic real-time performance monitoring and analysis engine, Turbonomic is able to provide right-sizing information for each service as well as the entire IT stack.
  * Right-sizing up your Pod limit, if necessary, to avoid OOM
  * Right-sizing down your Pod requested resource, if necessary, to avoid resource over-provisioning or overspending in public cloud deployment.

## Coming Soon
* What-If Planner in 6.4
  * A complete What-If sandbox to help you plan your IT changes in advance
  * Plan for workload change: Add/Remove Containers
  * Plan for infrastructure change: Add/Remove/Replace Nodes
* Also in 6.4: 
    * Manage guaranteed resources: insight into requests across the cluster
    * Consistent resizing of containers for the same service
* Storage control for persistent volumes
* Added dimensions in SLO based control
    * Manage horizontal scaling of services without thresholds
    * Manage the trade-offs of performance, availability of resources, and compliance
    * Leverage your SLO data to add response time and throughput leveraging telemetry data collected  - [Istio](http://istio.io), [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io), etc
* Support for Cluster Federation Control Plane
  * Complete visibility for your K8s deployments across different underlying infrastructures
  * Create affinity/anti-affinity policies directly from Turbonomic UI
  * Improve cost efficiency by consolidating workload across deployments and identifying the cheapest region and provider to deploy your workload
  * What-if planning for Cluster Consolidation for federated clusters
