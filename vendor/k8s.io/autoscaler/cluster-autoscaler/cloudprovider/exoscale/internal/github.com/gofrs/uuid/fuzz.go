package uuid

// Fuzz implements a simple fuzz test for FromString / UnmarshalText.
//
// To run:
//
//     $ go get github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz/...
//     $ cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io/autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/exoscale/internal/uuid
//     $ go-fuzz-build k8s.io/autoscaler/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/exoscale/internal/uuid
//     $ go-fuzz -bin=uuid-fuzz.zip -workdir=./testdata
//
// If you make significant changes to FromString / UnmarshalText and add
// new cases to fromStringTests (in codec_test.go), please run
//
//    $ go test -seed_fuzz_corpus
//
// to seed the corpus with the new interesting inputs, then run the fuzzer.
